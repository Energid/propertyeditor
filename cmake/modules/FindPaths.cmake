#
# The following variable is provided, but seem to be unused:
#  LIBS_HTML_INSTALL_DIR    /share/doc/HTML            CACHE STRING "Is this still used ?")
#
# The following user adjustable options are provided:

#  KDE4_ENABLE_FINAL - enable KDE-style enable-final all-in-one-compilation
#  KDE4_BUILD_TESTS  - enable this to build the testcases
#  KDE4_ENABLE_FPIE  - enable it to use gcc Position Independent Executables feature
#
# It also adds the following macros (from KDE4Macros.cmake)
#  KDE4_ADD_UI_FILES (SRCS_VAR file1.ui ... fileN.ui)
#    Use this to add Qt designer ui files to your application/library.
#
#  KDE4_ADD_UI3_FILES (SRCS_VAR file1.ui ... fileN.ui)
#    Use this to add Qt designer ui files from Qt version 3 to your application/library.

#
#  KDE4_ADD_WIDGET_FILES (SRCS_VAR file1.widgets ... fileN.widgets)
#    Use this to add widget description files for the makekdewidgets code generator
#    for Qt Designer plugins.
#
#  KDE4_CREATE_FINAL_FILES (filename_CXX filename_C file1 ... fileN)
#    This macro is intended mainly for internal uses.
#    It is used for enable-final. It will generate two source files,
#    one for the C files and one for the C++ files.
#    These files will have the names given in filename_CXX and filename_C.
#
#  KDE4_ADD_PLUGIN ( name [WITH_PREFIX] file1 ... fileN )
#    Create a KDE plugin (KPart, kioslave, etc.) from the given source files.
#    It supports KDE4_ENABLE_FINAL.
#    If WITH_PREFIX is given, the resulting plugin will have the prefix "lib", otherwise it won't.
#    It creates and installs an appropriate libtool la-file.
#
#  KDE4_ADD_KDEINIT_EXECUTABLE (name [NOGUI] [RUN_UNINSTALLED] file1 ... fileN)
#    Create a KDE application in the form of a module loadable via kdeinit.
#    A library named kdeinit_<name> will be created and a small executable which links to it.
#    It supports KDE4_ENABLE_FINAL
#    If the executable has to be run from the buildtree (e.g. unit tests and code generators
#    used later on when compiling), set the option RUN_UNINSTALLED.
#    If the executable doesn't have a GUI, use the option NOGUI. By default on OS X
#    application bundles are created, with the NOGUI option no bundles but simple executables
#    are created. Currently it doesn't have any effect on other platforms.
#
#  KDE4_ADD_EXECUTABLE (name [NOGUI] [TEST] [RUN_UNINSTALLED] file1 ... fileN)
#    Equivalent to ADD_EXECUTABLE(), but additionally adds some more features:
#    -support for KDE4_ENABLE_FINAL
#    -support for automoc
#    -automatic RPATH handling
#    If the executable has to be run from the buildtree (e.g. unit tests and code generators
#    used later on when compiling), set the option RUN_UNINSTALLED.
#    If the executable doesn't have a GUI, use the option NOGUI. By default on OS X
#    application bundles are created, with the NOGUI option no bundles but simple executables
#    are created. Currently it doesn't have any effect on other platforms.
#
#  KDE4_ADD_LIBRARY (name [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE ] file1 ... fileN)
#    Equivalent to ADD_LIBRARY(), but additionally it supports KDE4_ENABLE_FINAL
#    and under Windows it adds a -DMAKE_<name>_LIB definition to the compilation.
#
#  KDE4_ADD_UNIT_TEST (testname [TESTNAME targetname] file1 ... fileN)
#    add a unit test, which is executed when running make test
#    it will be built with RPATH poiting to the build dir
#    The targets are always created, but only built for the "all"
#    target if the option KDE4_BUILD_TESTS is enabled. Otherwise the rules for the target
#    are created but not built by default. You can build them by manually building the target.
#    The name of the target can be specified using TESTNAME <targetname>, if it is not given
#    the macro will default to the <testname>
#    KDESRCDIR is set to the source directory of the test, this can be used with
#    KGlobal::dirs()->addResourceDir( "data", KDESRCDIR )
#
#  KDE4_UPDATE_ICONCACHE()
#    Notifies the icon cache that new icons have been installed by updating
#    mtime of ${ICON_INSTALL_DIR}/hicolor directory.
#
#  KDE4_INSTALL_ICONS( path theme)
#    Installs all png and svgz files in the current directory to the icon
#    directoy given in path, in the subdirectory for the given icon theme.
#
#  KDE4_CREATE_HANDBOOK( docbookfile [INSTALL_DESTINATION installdest] [SUBDIR subdir])
#   Create the handbook from the docbookfile (using meinproc4)
#   The resulting handbook will be installed to <installdest> when using
#   INSTALL_DESTINATION <installdest>, or to <installdest>/<subdir> if
#   SUBDIR <subdir> is specified.
#
#  KDE4_CREATE_MANPAGE( docbookfile section )
#   Create the manpage for the specified section from the docbookfile (using meinproc4)
#   The resulting manpage will be installed to <installdest> when using
#   INSTALL_DESTINATION <installdest>, or to <installdest>/<subdir> if
#   SUBDIR <subdir> is specified.
#
#
#  A note on the possible values for CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE and how KDE handles
#  the flags for those buildtypes. FindKDE4Internal supports the values
#  Debug, Release, Relwithdebinfo, Profile and Debugfull
#
#  Release
#          optimised for speed, qDebug/kDebug turned off, no debug symbols
#  Release with debug info
#          optimised for speed, debugging symbols on (-g)
#  Debug
#          optimised but debuggable, debugging on (-g)
#          (-fno-reorder-blocks -fno-schedule-insns -fno-inline)
#  DebugFull
#          no optimisation, full debugging on (-g3)
#  Profile
#          DebugFull + -ftest-coverage -fprofile-arcs
#
#  It is expected that the "Debug" build type be still debuggable with gdb
#  without going all over the place, but still produce better performance.
#  It's also important to note that gcc cannot detect all warning conditions
#  unless the optimiser is active.
#
#  This module allows to depend on a particular minimum version of kdelibs.
#  To acomplish that one should use the apropriate cmake syntax for
#  find_package. For example to depend on kdelibs >= 4.1.0 one should use
#
#  find_package(KDE4 4.1.0 REQUIRED)
#
#  In earlier versions of KDE you could use the variable KDE_MIN_VERSION to
#  have such a dependency. This variable is deprecated with KDE 4.2.0, but
#  will still work to make the module backwards-compatible.

   # This macro implements some very special logic how to deal with the cache.
   # By default the various install locations inherit their value from their "parent" variable
   # so if you set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, then EXEC_INSTALL_PREFIX, PLUGIN_INSTALL_DIR will
   # calculate their value by appending subdirs to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX .
   # This would work completely without using the cache.
   # But if somebody wants e.g. a different EXEC_INSTALL_PREFIX this value has to go into
   # the cache, otherwise it will be forgotten on the next cmake run.
   # Once a variable is in the cache, it doesn't depend on its "parent" variables
   # anymore and you can only change it by editing it directly.
   # this macro helps in this regard, because as long as you don't set one of the
   # variables explicitely to some location, it will always calculate its value from its
   # parents. So modifying CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX later on will have the desired effect.
   # But once you decide to set e.g. EXEC_INSTALL_PREFIX to some special location
   # this will go into the cache and it will no longer depend on CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.
